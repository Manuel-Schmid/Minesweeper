### Project Information and Documentation

We, the three listed contributers, are students in a Cantonal School in Switzerland. 
In one of our classes we were given four weeks to develop a Minesweeper-Project with a console interface. The Language was required to be Java.
The purpose of this task was to use the Scrum-Process to create a team-project with a well documented and planned procedure. We also
used DevOps to manage our project-tasks and timelines.
<br/>

We have written an in-depth project documentation (in german) which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Manuel-Schmid/Minesweeper/blob/master/src/Minesweeper%20Project-Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>
<br/>

### Achievements

The project was evaluated and we achieved a grade of 5.8 (a 6 would the best possible grade in swiss schools).
We were happy about that result and we had fun working together on this project. This was the first time I
used recursion in an actual project and it was quite interesting.
